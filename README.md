# FoosballReferee

Android app for foosball (baby football, table football) referees

There are a big timer buttons for attack and defense, timeout buttons and score buttons. 
On my mind, I need use something like MVC with a class which holds a state of buttons and labels. 
With current skill I'll use mb a bad practices and solutions, but I'll grow up in future.
